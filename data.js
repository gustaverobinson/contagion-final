    description: 'Walmart Inc’s Store #1654 is located in Baxter, Minnesota. During the initial Covid-19 pandemic quarantine of March 2020, the Supercenter became one of few public spaces frequented by many of Baxter’s eight thousand residents. Starting during the quarantine and continuing through August of that year, I gave 30 hours a week in service to my community as a second-shift stocker at the store.<br><br>The following diary entries weave together my memories of Walmart, its frontline workers, and the cross-section of America that wandered its aisles in search of baking ingredients, crafting scissors, and toilet paper during the pandemic’s adolescent days.<br><br>To start navigating through the diary, click one of the blue markers on the map to the left of this text and then select View Details.'

    description: 'Monday-<br>Every day before entering the store, I fill out an attestation confirming that I am not experiencing symptoms of Covid nor have I come into contact with anyone who is. I then walk from my car to the employee entrance and screening area where a member of management takes my temperature and confirms that I have filled out the form. I have never heard of anyone being sent home for failing screening. After all, retail workers don’t get sick. Retail workers don’t have the benefit of getting sick. Retail workers who get sick are no longer retail workers.<br><br>This screening ritual might provide reassurance to Susan (age 55, owner-occupant of a respectable four bedroom on Perch Lake), but when my coworkers start to feel the symptoms of working short-staffed during a pandemic, their care protocol consists of a crack of the back, a well-placed brace, and a return to work.<br><br>In the early days of the pandemic, the store offered a novel, paid two-week leave in cases of government-mandated quarantine. But the benefit of getting sick is rapidly eroding as the CDC determines that it is better for society that infected frontline workers return to work more quickly after they have passed peak viral load.<br><br>Thursday-<br>A concerned member of the community left home-made masks for us to wear last week. A majority still sit on the check-in table unused–seemingly the only thing that we can keep in stock at the store. To comply with the store’s mandate that employees wear masks, most members of the stocking team have instead opted to wear a blue Mission hydroactive neck gaiter. Essentially a single layer of a spandex and polyester blend, the gaiter makes up for its lack of efficacy in preventing infection by being cool (in both the thermal and social sense). Many of those who wear neck gaiters aren’t anti-maskers per se, but all are completely uninterested in costuming their face with quilting scraps.<br><br>I choose to wear the store-provided surgical mask but like to think that by accepting this well-intentioned gift, the store has, at the very least, provided the facebook group that made it with a sense of control over an environment of chaos.'

    description: 'Monday-<br>Stocking the paper aisle during a pandemic is a bit like stocking the beer cooler for a freshman dorm party during orientation week. You know that your customers will take far more than they truly need and they don’t really care how artfully you arrange your goods. This has made working in the paper aisle much easier than it was pre-pandemic.<br><br>Naturally, we are low on toilet paper as we have been since the start of the lockdown. More interestingly, we have also struggled to keep paper plates in stock.<br><br>I see two potential explanations for this: 1) central Minnesota is experiencing a wave of Covid parties or 2) people who are accustomed to eating out have no idea how to clean their own dishes. Either way, I find it fascinating that in ten thousand years when an archaeologist reaches the stratum of rubbish created by an environmentally-unconscious society in the year 2020, they will be asked to reconcile the phenomena of moving from the stone age, to the bronze age, to the iron age, to the age of single-use paper plates coated in a polymer that requires thousands of years to degrade.'

Surely, tomorrow’s pre-shift meeting will start with a reminder not to do anything that could make a customer uncomfortable.<br><br>The far more effective solution, dedicating a second set of hands to help with the oversized load that is a household chemicals pallet during a pandemic, would have been the systemic response to Brad’s propensity for sweating and short-windedness. This solution won’t be implemented due to the shortage of workers willing to condemn themselves to a lifetime of arthritis for fourteen dollars an hour.'

This solution won’t be implemented because a consultant has determined that maintaining the current width maximizes the revenue per square foot generated by the aisle of pet food.'

The primordial stew that new parents must brave in order to procure their infant’s supply of Gerber’s Organic Carrot and Pea Puree and bluetooth-enabled baby monitor.

    description: 'Saturday-<br>The home office department is home to one of my favorite aisles in the whole store: Hallmark greeting cards. The sanitized tingle of mass-market empathy fitting for any occasion never fails to fill me with a carefully-measured dose of we-feeling. In the face of rising death tolls from a global pandemic and institutionalized racism, a capitalist society finds solace in the closure that a Hallmark card provides. Those who give a sympathy card are made to feel that they have fulfilled their obligation to care. It is through this token of ritualized commemoration that the community acknowledges individual suffering before moving forward again.<br><br>After all, nothing says “I’m here for you in your loss” quite like a Hallmark card that reads “I’m here for you in your loss.”'

I know this because today’s staff meeting began with a reminder not to do anything that could make a customer uncomfortable. Specifically, we were reminded not to use profanities or explicit expressions in front of customers and to bathe regularly.<br><br>The end of retail workers’ claim to heroism in the narrative that our customers have created is unfortunate but not unexpected.  These narratives relied on our customer’s need for “worthy patients,” “Good Samaritans,” and “heroic frontline workers,” but uncensored, human moments like these have combined with society’s lurking distaste for retail workers to end our MVP status.<br><br>Fortunately, the doctors are still welcome to play this role.'
